# Data Analysis Ecosystem

A data analysis ecosystem includes the infrastructure, software, tools, frameworks, and processes used to collect, clean, analyze, extract, and visualize data.

Depending on how well-defined the data structure is, they can be classified as:

- **Structured Data**: Well-organized data in formats that can be stored in databases.
- **Semi-structured Data**: Partially organized and partially free-form data.
- **Unstructured Data**: Data that cannot be conventionally organized into rows and columns.

Data comes in a wide variety of file formats, such as delimited text files, spreadsheets, XML, PDF, and JSON, each with its own list of advantages and usage limitations.

Data is extracted from multiple data sources, from relational and non-relational databases to APIs, web services, data streams, social platforms, and sensor devices.

Once data from different sources are identified and collected, they need to be organized into a data repository to prepare them for analysis. The type, format, and sources of the data influence the type of data repository that can be used.

Data professionals need a range of languages to help them extract, prepare, and analyze data. These can be classified as:

- **Query Languages**: Such as SQL, used to access and manipulate data in databases.
- **Programming Languages**: Like Python, R, and Java, to develop applications and control their behavior.
- **Shell and Scripting Languages**: Such as Unix/Linux Shell, and PowerShell, to automate repetitive operational tasks.
