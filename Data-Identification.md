# Data Identification and Gathering Process

The data identification process begins by determining the information that needs to be collected, which in turn is determined by the objective it aims to achieve.

Once the data is identified, the next step is to identify the sources from which the necessary data will be extracted and define a data collection plan. Decisions regarding the timeframe in which your data set is needed and how much data would be sufficient for a credible analysis also weigh in at this stage.

Data sources can be internal or external to the organization, and they can be primary, secondary, or third-party, depending on whether you are getting the data directly from the original source, retrieving it from externally available data sources, or purchasing it from data aggregators.

Some of the data sources from which you might be collecting data include databases, the web, social media, interactive platforms, sensor devices, data exchanges, surveys, and observational studies.

The data identified and collected from various data sources are combined using a variety of tools and methods to provide a single interface through which the data can be queried and manipulated.

The data that is identified, the source of that data, and the practices used to collect them have implications for quality, security, and privacy, which must be taken into account at this stage.
