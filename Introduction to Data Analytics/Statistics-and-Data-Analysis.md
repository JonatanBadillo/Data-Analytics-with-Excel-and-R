# Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of numerical or quantitative data.

Statistical Analysis involves the use of statistical methods to develop an understanding of what the data represent.

Statistical Analysis can be:

- **Descriptive**: which provides a summary of what the data represent. Common measures include central tendency, dispersion, and skewness.

- **Inferential**: which involves making inferences, or generalizations, about the data. Common measures include Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals, and Regression Analysis.

Data Mining, in short, is the process of extracting knowledge from data. It involves the use of pattern recognition technologies, statistical analysis, and mathematical techniques to identify correlations, patterns, variations, and trends in the data.

There are several techniques that can help extract data, such as classifying data attributes, clustering data into groups, and establishing relationships between events, variables, and inputs and outputs.

There is a wide variety of software and tools for analyzing and extracting data. Some of the most commonly used ones include spreadsheets, the R language, Python, IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Watson Studio, and SAS, each with its own set of features, strengths, limitations, and applications.
