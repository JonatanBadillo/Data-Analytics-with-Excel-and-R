# R Programming: README

You can use the R programming language for statistical calculations, data visualization, and predictive analysis.

The four most common data types in R are integer, numeric, character, and logical.

You can use the `class()` function and the `is.integer()`, `is.numeric()`, `is.character()`, and `is.logical()` functions to determine the data type.

You can convert some data types into other data types using the `as.integer()`, `as.numeric()`, `as.character()`, and `as.logical()` functions.

R provides mathematical operators that you can use to perform calculations on your data.

Using variables in your calculations and giving them descriptive names can help shorten your code and make it easier to read.

You can control the order of operations using parentheses.

The R development environment includes the R console, R script files, and workspaces.

Two important tools for working with R code are RStudio and Jupyter.

RStudio features like syntax highlighting and code autocompletion make writing code easier.

The main components of RStudio include the file editor, console, workspace, and file explorer, plots, and packages.

A Jupyter notebook is composed of cells that can contain code, markdown files, or raw text.

A Jupyter notebook contains narration, code, data, and graphics, images, or videos.
