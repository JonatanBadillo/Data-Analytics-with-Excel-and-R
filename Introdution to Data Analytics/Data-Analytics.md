A modern data ecosystem includes a network of interconnected and constantly evolving entities that include:

- Data available in myriad formats, structures, and different sources.
  
- Enterprise data environment where raw data is staged so it can be organized, cleansed, and optimized for use by end-users.
  
- End-users such as business stakeholders, analysts, and programmers who consume the data for various purposes.
  
Emerging technologies such as cloud computing, machine learning, and big data are continuously reshaping the data ecosystem and the possibilities it offers. Data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, business analysts, and business intelligence analysts play a vital role in the ecosystem to gain insights and business outcomes from the data.

Depending on the objectives and outcomes to be achieved, there are four main types of Data Analysis:

- Descriptive Analysis, which helps decipher "what happened".
  
- Diagnostic Analysis, which helps understand "why it happened".
  
- Predictive Analysis, which analyzes historical data and trends to suggest "what will happen next".
  
- Prescriptive Analysis, which prescribes "what should be done next".
  
The Data Analysis process involves:

- Developing an understanding of the problem and desired outcome.
  
- Establishing a clear metric to evaluate results.
  
- Collecting, cleansing, analyzing, and extracting data to interpret results.
  
- Communicating findings in a way that impacts decision-making.
